# MAVLink2Zenoh: The Mystical Conduit

Venture forth into the realm of MAVLink2Zenoh, a magical bridge that connects the ancient scrolls of [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/) to the enchanted lands of [Zenoh](https://zenoh.io/).

### Discover the Enchanted Powers
This sorcerous tool forges a link between a MAVLink source and the powerful [Zenoh server](https://zenoh.io/). What spells and charms does this union bestow? The answers lie within Zenoh's mystical essence!

Channel your data streams into the arcane vaults of [influxdb2](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-backend-influxdb), crafting a sacred repository for MAVLink's ancient data. Through Zenoh's wizardry, summon the might of a REST API server, echoing the legendary capabilities of [MAVLink2Rest](https://github.com/mavlink/mavlink2rest).

Merge Zenoh with the [DDS bridge](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-plugin-dds), unlocking access to the revered MAVLink message scripts via DDS. But, brave adventurer, the magic does not end there!

Invoke the power of the [MQTT plugin](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-plugin-mqtt), a mystical extension that binds the realms of MQTT communication into this grand spellwork. With this enchantment, your dominion over data and connectivity expands, weaving together diverse threads of communication into a tapestry of technological synergy.

Prepare yourself for more arcane revelations, for the journey with MAVLink2Zenoh is ever-evolving and full of wonder!
